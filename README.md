Mentor : Neela Santosh Kumar
Completing Big Data Analysis with PySpark in VS Code
**Project Overview**
My recent big data analysis project represented a comprehensive journey through modern data engineering practices, combining the power of Apache Spark's Python API with real-world datasets from Kaggle. 
Working within the Visual Studio Code environment, I was able to leverage a robust development framework that streamlined the entire analytical workflow from data acquisition to insight generation.
**Implementing pyspark and reading dataset**
 I configured my workspace with essential extensions including Python, Jupyter, and PySpark syntax highlighting. The integrated terminal allowed seamless execution of Spark commands, while the intelligent code completion and debugging features significantly accelerated development time.
 With the environment configured, I initialized a SparkSession, the entry point for PySpark functionality. 
**Conclusion**
 Completing this big data analysis project using PySpark within VS Code, powered by Kaggle's rich datasets, demonstrated the accessibility of modern big data tools.This project reinforced how contemporary data science tools have democratized big data analytics, enabling individual practitioners to tackle problems previously reserved for large organizations.
**Output**
An output of a code which describing the change of column name and descrimination of updated column and data.
